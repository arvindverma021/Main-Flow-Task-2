SQL Project Summary: Advanced Queries with Joins and Filtering

This project focused on analyzing relationships between students, courses, and enrolments using SQL. The database schema included three tables: Students, Courses, and Enrolments, with proper primary and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.

The project tasks demonstrated the use of SQL joins, aggregation, and filtering techniques:

Task 1 retrieved all students and their enrolled courses using INNER JOIN.
Task 2 calculated the number of students per course through LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, and COUNT(), ensuring even courses with no enrolments were listed.
Task 3 identified students enrolled in multiple courses using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.
Task 4 found courses with no enrolled students via LEFT JOIN and WHERE conditions.
Key Insights:

Some courses had high enrolment while others had none, indicating potential areas for improvement.
A few students showed higher engagement by enrolling in multiple courses, presenting opportunities for targeted course recommendations.
This project showcased the ability to write efficient SQL queries for data analysis, enhancing database management and reporting skills.
